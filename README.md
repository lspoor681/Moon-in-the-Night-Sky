#    K/k will rotate the sky right and left
#    g will rotate the galaxies one step at a time G will animate it to be automated
#    p will change the view from parallel to perspective, I did not program this animation with
#     perspective in mind after I saw its odd effects on transitions, I don't suggest its use
#    r will reset the moon's position and phase to its default, being the origin and half
#    The ring around the blue planet when you press the 't' ket
#    +/- will reduce and add the amount of stars visible in the sky
#    The mouse have many functionalities depending on which window and where you are using it
#      in the Display window you can click and drag the moon to change its position as well as
#      right clicking to see the menu option such as change day to night, see wired and filled modes
#      and more. In the control panel it will simple act as a selector for the button objects.
